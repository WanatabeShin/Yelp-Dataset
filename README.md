# Yelp-Dataset
This is my Database Implementation from Yelp Dataset.

The code illustrates how I obtain information of every single restaurant from the JSON file. Then I built up a simple database.

Given a user's query, I can iterate the database and print out the information of all the restaurants that satisfy the query's request.
